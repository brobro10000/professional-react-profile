  # My React Portfolio
  ## **Description**
  This is a remake of my initial professional profile made here, redone as a single page applicatons using the following technologies.
  * [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/) 
  * [React-Bootstrap](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/)
  * [React-Icons](https://react-icons.github.io/react-icons/)
  * [Formspree](https://formspree.io/)
  
  Using these technologies, I was able to develop a unique professional portfolio that I could be proud to share with friends, families and future employers. Dynamically highlighting the repositories that are featured on my Github in my portfolio using the [Github API](https://docs.github.com/en/rest), we can always keep out featured projects up to date with nothing more then adding a picture to the directory, and importing the image.

 Once you arrive, you are greeted with a navigation bar up top, and a short description about me, as well as a motto. Never stop learning new things! By default, you load into the 'About' section of the homepage.

 ![Portfolio1](src/assets/images/portfoliSS.png)

 In the portfolio section, you have an interactable table of contents on the left for my featured repositories on [Github](https://github.com/brobro10000/), as well an ability to scroll through them on the right. 

 ![Portfolio2](src/assets/images/indexdb1SS.png)

 On click, it will replace the first item on the list, so no scrolling is necessary! If you do scroll, the table of contents will return you to the top of the page. 
 Each project has a link to the website and deployed application.
