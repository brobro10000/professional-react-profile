  # My React Portfolio
  ## **Description**
  This is a remake of my initial professional profile made here, redone as a single page applicatons using the following technologies.
  * [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/) 
  * [React-Bootstrap](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/)
  * [React-Icons](https://react-icons.github.io/react-icons/)
  * [Formspree](https://formspree.io/)
  
  Using these technologies, I was able to develop a unique professional portfolio that I could be proud to share with friends, families and future employers. Dynamically highlighting the repositories that are featured on my Github in my portfolio using the [Github API](https://docs.github.com/en/rest), we can always keep out featured projects up to date with nothing more then adding a picture to the directory, and importing the image.
